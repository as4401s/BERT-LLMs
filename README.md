### Overview

BERT, developed by Google, is a transformer-based model that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and can be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks.

This repository provides practical implementations, visualizations, and insights into:

BERT Visualizations: Understanding BERT's attention mechanisms and embeddings.
BERT Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained BERT for custom tasks.
Sequence Classification with BERT: Using BERT for tasks like sentiment analysis.
Question Answering with BERT: Building QA models with BERT.

## BERT Architecture

The architecture of BERT includes multiple transformer encoder layers. The diagram below shows how BERT processes input sequences:

![BERT Architecture](https://github.com/as4401s/BERT-LLMs/blob/main/images/0.png)

- **BERT Base:** 
  - 12 Transformer layers
  - 110M parameters
- **BERT Large:** 
  - 24 Transformer layers
  - 340M parameters
- Both models use multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.

## Input Embeddings

The diagram below illustrates how input embeddings are constructed in a Transformer-based model:

1. **Token Embeddings:** Represent individual tokens.
2. **Segment Embeddings:** Differentiate between two input segments.
3. **Positional Embeddings:** Encode token position in the sequence.

- Input: Tokenized sequence such as `[CLS] I love llamas`.
- Layers: 12 or 24 Transformer encoder layers process the sequence to produce contextualized word embeddings.
