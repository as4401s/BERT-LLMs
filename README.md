###Overview

BERT, developed by Google, is a transformer-based model that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and can be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks.

This repository provides practical implementations, visualizations, and insights into:

BERT Visualizations: Understanding BERT's attention mechanisms and embeddings.
BERT Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained BERT for custom tasks.
Sequence Classification with BERT: Using BERT for tasks like sentiment analysis.
Question Answering with BERT: Building QA models with BERT.

###Features
Interactive Visualizations: Gain insights into BERT's inner workings, including attention heads and embeddings.
Transfer Learning Tutorials: Learn to adapt BERT for your own datasets and tasks.

###Practical Implementations:
Sequence classification (e.g., sentiment analysis).
Question answering with pre-trained BERT models.
